Ising2D
=======

A 2D Ising model of ferromagnetism using the Metropolis algorthim.

Requirements
=======
To graph the data using the python script plot.py the following libaries are required.

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib

Output
=======
the program saves measurements to a csv file. This file is read by
the plot.py script to plot the following graphs. 

#####Figure One:
  >The plot above shows the magnetization per site while the plot below shows the enegry per site.
